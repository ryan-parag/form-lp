            <p> <strong>Hi there! </strong>I am excited to having lunch with you! Over the past year at Airbnb, I was fortunate enough to host over 50 people at Airbnb; sharing many memories, laughes and stories. To be honest, I consider myself very lucky and fortunate to work at a place that offers healthy, delicious food, and allows me to enjoy these meals with friends and family. In an effort of spreading belonging, <a href="#">I'd like to invite you to have lunch with me at Airbnb.</a></p>
            <h3 class="m-t--4">Why have lunch with me at Airbnb</h3>

              <ul class="m-b--4">
                <li>The food is delicious and crafted with care and love by our food team</li>
                <li>Visit Airbnb's beautiful office, learn about the company's history, people and mission</li>
                <li>Making new friends (I will try to group 2-3 people per visit)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="m-t--4">A little about me</h3>
